# ROSWebServer

This code is to be deployed on an EC2 Instance of AWS Cloud.

## Purpose

The purpose of this application is to provide a Web Interface for visualizing data of ROS-based robots. It also serves to send control commands to the robot from anywhere in the world as long as the robot is connected to the Web Application.

So far, we have tested its working on the following platforms:
- Turtlebot3 Robot (Gazebo Simulation)
- Turtlebot3 Robot (Burger - Actual hardware)

## Installations

1. Activate Virtual Environment:
```shell
source venv/bin/activate
```
